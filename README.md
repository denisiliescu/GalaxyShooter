Description:  
Galaxy Space Shooter, the 2D game that I first developed, started with the project creation of a 2D template in Unity where I imported the assets needed for developing the game. The beginning consisted of creating the galaxy looking like background, then, I started creating the player ship and coded the movement for it using user inputs. Next, I implemented the laser beams that are going to be shot and the power-ups that will help in the fight against the enemy ships. Lastly, the User Interface was implemented to show the score and the lives remaining for our player, I have applied visual and sound effects in the game to give it a more advanced touch and in the end I learned how the game can be built and shared to the platforms supported by Unity.
